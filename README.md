# NeuralNetwork

Welcome to see our project! The project is about implementing a neural network with backpropagation. The structure of the neural network can be decided by the user. So, this neural network is capable of handling even deeper structure.

The program is made with C. On of the reasons is that this way we can make it efficient.

## Goals

### Create a neural network which can be adjusted

In other words, the idea is to create a program in a way that there is no hard coding.

Things that can be adjusted:
- dataset (input vectors)
- the count of input nodes (length of an input vector) and output nodes
- the count of hidden layers and ...
- ... the count of the nodes on the each hidden layer
- iterations
- learning rate
- activation function used (ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Sigmoid)

This freedom helps not only user but also us to continue the development.

### High prediction accuracy

Our goal is to achieve as high prediction accuracy as possible but at least something like 85%.

Disclaimer: The data affects to this so no promises! This is just our goal with our dataset.
