# NeuralNetwork

Welcome to see our project! The project is about implementing a neural network with backpropagation. The structure of the neural network can be decided by the user. So, this neural network is capable of handling even deeeep .

## Goals

### Create a neural network which can be adjusted

In other words, the idea is to create a program in a way that there is no hard coding.

Things that can be adjusted:
- dataset (input vectors)
- the count of input and output nodes
- the count of hidden layers and ...
- ... the count of the nodes on the each hidden layer
- iterations
- learning rate
- activation function used (ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Sigmoid)

This freedom helps not only user but also us to continue the development.
